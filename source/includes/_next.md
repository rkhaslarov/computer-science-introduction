# What's next?

And you've nailed it! However, I don't wanna make you upset but it's just a beginning of your developer path. 
What should you learn next? Actually, it depends on what you'll choose. Please refer to the https://roadmap.sh website.
There you can find the "algorithms" of self-improvement in different areas for the next few years. 

Despite that, do not forget to try yourself in computer science, you're able to join for free to the courses below on coursera.org.

In addition to that, there is an option to study and get the bachelor or master degree online!

And let me give you several **advices**:

* always stick to one task at a time
* don’t be afraid to ask for help or to help people back
* it might be hard but don’t give up
* don’t compare yourself to others, people are different
* it’s okay if you don’t understand
* don’t over-practice though, think of your health as well
