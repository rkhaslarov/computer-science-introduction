```Homework
And here you are. Let's start the next challenge. 

What you have to do is the following:

Imagine that you were snowed under at your job and forgot to wash dishes. 
Now you have to do that immediately because your mom is coming. 
Create a flowchart of the algorithm and take into account the amount of the dishes (10).

Your friend asked you to go to grocery shopping and gave you a list. 
Create a flowchart of the algorithm (use given arrays of goods).

And the last one, you need to prepare the list of favourite films of your friend. 
Create a flowchart of the algorithm (use array).

Good luck!
```

The module opens the door to the next key topics of the programming such as variables, data types, loops and arrays. And of course, there will be intro to the functions.
