- Unix - operating system developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie;
- Richard Stallman - developed a free Unix-like operating system. He created GNU - open source - to paved way to one of 
the largest open source operating system - Linux - created by Linus Torvalds.
* PDAs - Personal Digital Assistants - mobile computing - Nokia introduced a PDA with mobile phone functionality;

 __Computer Architecture Layer__

Abstraction. To take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use. We have a mouse, keyboard to use and interact with the computer system without having to know and understand the underlying technical details (under the hood) or undelying implementation of the technology.
 
**Computer Architecture Overview**

* Hardware - physical components of a computer;
* Operating System - allows hardware to communicate with the system;
* Software - humans interact with computers;
* Users - Interacts with a computer - operate, program , etc;

**Introduction to computer hardware**

* Ports - Connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer.
* CPU - central processing unit - it communicates heavily with the RAM.
* RAM (Random Access Memory) - Computer's short-term memory - used to store data temporarily.
* Hard drive - holds all of our data, which includes all of our music, pictures and applications. (long term memory);
* Motherboard - foundation of the computer - the body or circuitory system of the computer that connects all the pieces together.
* Power supply - electricity from wall outlet onto a format that our computer can use.

**Program and Hardware**

**Programs** - instructions that tell the computer what to do.

Inside the CPU there are components known as **Registers**. Registers - stores the data that our CPU works with. To add two numbers - one is stores in register A and the other in register B, and the result is stored in register C.

RAM is not the fastest way to get more data to the CPU, the CPU also uses cache. Cache - smaller than RAM but let's us store data often use / quickly reference. Cache - there are three different cache levels in a CPU : L1, L2, and L3. L1 - smallest and fastest cache;

How does the CPU know when the set of instructions ends, and when a new one begins? CPU - has an internal clock - that keeps the operation in sync, it connects to a clock wire.Overclocking - Increase the rate of CPU clock cycles in order to perform more tasks.

__Hardware Components__

**CPU.** 

Common CPU/ chipset manufacturers - Intel (Intel Core i7), AMD (AMD Athlon), Qualcomm (Snapdragon 810), Apple (Apple A8). CPU has an instruction set that enables it to process instructions. When you select your CPU, you'll need to make sure it's compatible with your motherboard -- the circuit board that connects all the components together;

2 types of motherboard sockets - CPU and motherboard socket must match:

 - Land grid array (LGA)
 - Pin grid Array (PGA)

Require a Heat sink - to prevent the CPU from overheating. It takes the heat from the CPU and dissipates it through a fan/ another medium;

CPU architecture - based on the way CPU handles data.

 - 32 bit
 - 64 bit - handles large amounts of RAM more effectively (4GB), more responsive when running several programs at the same time and switching between them frequently. 

**RAM (RAM stick needs to be compatible with the motherboard)**

Computer's Short Term Memory - store data that we want to access quickly, it is volatile. The computer is comprised of programs, to run a program we need to make a copy of it in the RAM so that the CPU can process it. RAM - 16GB - 16 Gb of programs can be run in that time.

Lots of RAMS, commonly found is - DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory).

DRAM: When a 1 or 0 is sent to DRAM it stores eash bit in a microscopic capacitor. Based on the value 1 or 0 the capitor is
charged or discharged. These semiconductors are put into a chip that are on the RAM and store the data.

SDRAM - Synchronous DRAM. This RAM is synchronized to the system's clock speed allowing quicker processing of data.

DDR SDRAM - Double Data Rate SDRAM. DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4. Faster, less power, larger capacity. Programs can run faster and more programs can be run simultaneously;

**Motherboards**

Foundation that holds the computer together. Expands computer functionality by adding expansion cards. Routes power from supply. Enables different parts of the computer to communicate with each other (manages data between CPU, RAM and peripherals);

Chipset - decides how components communicate with each other in the machine. Chipset is made of 2 chips.

 - Northbridge - interconnected RAM, Video cards , etc; (it could be integrated into CPU);
 - Southbridge - maintain I/O controllers - hard drives, USB devices;

Pheripherals - external devices we connect to our computer- mouse, keyboard, monitor, etc. Expansion Slots - provide the ability to increase the functionality of the computer. Standard for expansion slots - PCI Express - Pheripheral Component Interconnect Express

Form factor. Different mother board sizes available, decide the amount that can be put into them. Common form factor - ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended) - diffeerent sizes. ITX - Information Technology eXtended;

**Storage**

Data size:

 - smallest unit of a data storage is a bit; (1/0)
 - byte - comprised of 8 bits;
 - 1 Kilobyte - 1024 bytes;
 - 1 MB - 1024 KB
 - 1 GB - 1024 MB
 - 1 TB -> 1024GB
 
Hard Drive - allows to store programs files. Two basic types of hard drives used:

* Hard disk drives - HDDs - use a spinning platter and a mechanical arm to read and write information. The speed the platter rotates allows you to read and write data faster. RPM (Revolution per Minute) (eg hard drive - 500gb - 5400 rpm). Affordable.

* Solid state drives - SSDs - no moving parts - similar to USB stick information is stored on microchips and data travels a lot faster than HDDs. Form factor is slimmer than HDDs; expensive.
  
* Hybrid SSD and HDD drives;

**Power supplies**

Computers - convert electricity from volts to useable. Consists of fan, voltage information, cables -> motherboard, power cable.
 
**Peripherals**
  
USB - Universal Serial Bus - popular connections for gadgets; USB 2.0,3.0, and 3.1. USB 2.0 - Transfer spead - 480 Mb/s (megabit per second) and not megabytes. USB 3.0 - Transfer speed of 5 Gb/s. USB 3.1 - Transfer speed of 10 Gb/s. Backward compatible, olderr ones are compatible with newer ports.
  
Type-C Connector - new and common - outputs audio, video, data and power.
  
Display peripherals - monitors have them:

* DVI cables are for video output;
* HDMI - Video and audio output;
* DisplayPort - outputs video and audio;
