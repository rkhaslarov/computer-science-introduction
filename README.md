Necessary knowledge
------------

Despite the fact, that the course is created for newcomers in IT, it's really important for a student to be able to work with a PC itself on the basic level (usage of browser, office software and so on). 

Description
------------

Are you a newcomer in programming and IT? Does it look complicated, painful and unclear? Is it a gray area for you? So, here it is. The course is designed especially for you. During the course, we're going to get through the essentials of the main areas of IT starting with computer hardware and finishing with data structures and algorithms. We'll help you to make your first steps to your path of the success and fortune!
