</ul>

<p><strong>Computer Architecture Layer</strong></p>

<p>Abstraction. To take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use. We have a mouse, keyboard to use and interact with the computer system without having to know and understand the underlying technical details (under the hood) or undelying implementation of the technology.</p>

<p><strong>Computer Architecture Overview</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hardware - physical components of a computer;</li>
<li>Operating System - allows hardware to communicate with the system;</li>
<li>Software - humans interact with computers;</li>
<li>Users - Interacts with a computer - operate, program , etc;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Introduction to computer hardware</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ports - Connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer.</li>
<li>CPU - central processing unit - it communicates heavily with the RAM.</li>
<li>RAM (Random Access Memory) - Computer&#39;s short-term memory - used to store data temporarily.</li>
<li>Hard drive - holds all of our data, which includes all of our music, pictures and applications. (long term memory);</li>
<li>Motherboard - foundation of the computer - the body or circuitory system of the computer that connects all the pieces together.</li>
<li>Power supply - electricity from wall outlet onto a format that our computer can use.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Program and Hardware</strong></p>

<p><strong>Programs</strong> - instructions that tell the computer what to do.</p>

<p>Inside the CPU there are components known as <strong>Registers</strong>. Registers - stores the data that our CPU works with. To add two numbers - one is stores in register A and the other in register B, and the result is stored in register C.</p>

<p>RAM is not the fastest way to get more data to the CPU, the CPU also uses cache. Cache - smaller than RAM but let&#39;s us store data often use / quickly reference. Cache - there are three different cache levels in a CPU : L1, L2, and L3. L1 - smallest and fastest cache;</p>

<p>How does the CPU know when the set of instructions ends, and when a new one begins? CPU - has an internal clock - that keeps the operation in sync, it connects to a clock wire.Overclocking - Increase the rate of CPU clock cycles in order to perform more tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware Components</strong></p>

<p><strong>CPU.</strong> </p>

<p>Common CPU/ chipset manufacturers - Intel (Intel Core i7), AMD (AMD Athlon), Qualcomm (Snapdragon 810), Apple (Apple A8). CPU has an instruction set that enables it to process instructions. When you select your CPU, you&#39;ll need to make sure it&#39;s compatible with your motherboard -- the circuit board that connects all the components together;</p>

<p>2 types of motherboard sockets - CPU and motherboard socket must match:</p>

<ul>
<li>Land grid array (LGA)</li>
<li>Pin grid Array (PGA)</li>
</ul>

<p>Require a Heat sink - to prevent the CPU from overheating. It takes the heat from the CPU and dissipates it through a fan/ another medium;</p>

<p>CPU architecture - based on the way CPU handles data.</p>

<ul>
<li>32 bit</li>
<li>64 bit - handles large amounts of RAM more effectively (4GB), more responsive when running several programs at the same time and switching between them frequently. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>RAM (RAM stick needs to be compatible with the motherboard)</strong></p>

<p>Computer&#39;s Short Term Memory - store data that we want to access quickly, it is volatile. The computer is comprised of programs, to run a program we need to make a copy of it in the RAM so that the CPU can process it. RAM - 16GB - 16 Gb of programs can be run in that time.</p>

<p>Lots of RAMS, commonly found is - DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory).</p>

<p>DRAM: When a 1 or 0 is sent to DRAM it stores eash bit in a microscopic capacitor. Based on the value 1 or 0 the capitor is
charged or discharged. These semiconductors are put into a chip that are on the RAM and store the data.</p>

<p>SDRAM - Synchronous DRAM. This RAM is synchronized to the system&#39;s clock speed allowing quicker processing of data.</p>

<p>DDR SDRAM - Double Data Rate SDRAM. DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4. Faster, less power, larger capacity. Programs can run faster and more programs can be run simultaneously;</p>

<p><strong>Motherboards</strong></p>

<p>Foundation that holds the computer together. Expands computer functionality by adding expansion cards. Routes power from supply. Enables different parts of the computer to communicate with each other (manages data between CPU, RAM and peripherals);</p>

<p>Chipset - decides how components communicate with each other in the machine. Chipset is made of 2 chips.</p>

<ul>
<li>Northbridge - interconnected RAM, Video cards , etc; (it could be integrated into CPU);</li>
<li>Southbridge - maintain I/O controllers - hard drives, USB devices;</li>
</ul>

<p>Pheripherals - external devices we connect to our computer- mouse, keyboard, monitor, etc. Expansion Slots - provide the ability to increase the functionality of the computer. Standard for expansion slots - PCI Express - Pheripheral Component Interconnect Express</p>

<p>Form factor. Different mother board sizes available, decide the amount that can be put into them. Common form factor - ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended) - diffeerent sizes. ITX - Information Technology eXtended;</p>

<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>

<p>Data size:</p>

<ul>
<li>smallest unit of a data storage is a bit; (1/0)</li>
<li>byte - comprised of 8 bits;</li>
<li>1 Kilobyte - 1024 bytes;</li>
<li>1 MB - 1024 KB</li>
<li>1 GB - 1024 MB</li>
<li>1 TB -&gt; 1024GB</li>
</ul>

<p>Hard Drive - allows to store programs files. Two basic types of hard drives used:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hard disk drives - HDDs - use a spinning platter and a mechanical arm to read and write information. The speed the platter rotates allows you to read and write data faster. RPM (Revolution per Minute) (eg hard drive - 500gb - 5400 rpm). Affordable.</p></li>
<li><p>Solid state drives - SSDs - no moving parts - similar to USB stick information is stored on microchips and data travels a lot faster than HDDs. Form factor is slimmer than HDDs; expensive.</p></li>
<li><p>Hybrid SSD and HDD drives;</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Power supplies</strong></p>

<p>Computers - convert electricity from volts to useable. Consists of fan, voltage information, cables -&gt; motherboard, power cable.</p>

<p><strong>Peripherals</strong></p>

<p>USB - Universal Serial Bus - popular connections for gadgets; USB 2.0,3.0, and 3.1. USB 2.0 - Transfer spead - 480 Mb/s (megabit per second) and not megabytes. USB 3.0 - Transfer speed of 5 Gb/s. USB 3.1 - Transfer speed of 10 Gb/s. Backward compatible, olderr ones are compatible with newer ports.</p>

<p>Type-C Connector - new and common - outputs audio, video, data and power.</p>

<p>Display peripherals - monitors have them:</p>

<ul>
<li>DVI cables are for video output;</li>
<li>HDMI - Video and audio output;</li>
<li>DisplayPort - outputs video and audio;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='essentials-of-networking-and-the-internet-notes'>Essentials of Networking and the Internet notes</h2>
<p><strong>Networking</strong></p>

<p><strong>Internet</strong> - The physical connection of the computers and wires around the world;
<strong>Web</strong> - Information on the internet. Ways to access the internet - Web, Email, Chat, File-sharing programs;</p>

<p><strong>The Internet</strong> is composed of a massive network of satellites, cellular networks, and physical cables buried beneath the ground;
Computers called <strong>servers</strong> connect to the internet directly and not all pc, desktops;
<strong>Servers</strong> - store the websites we use - wikipedia, google, etc. These websites serve the content requested by the client (mobile phines, laptops, etc). Internet (Satellites/Cellular networks/cables) -&gt; Server -&gt; Websites (Google, wikipedia) -&gt; Client (phone, desktop);</p>

<p><strong>Clients</strong> don&#39;t connect directly to the internet, but connect to a network run by the ISP (Internet Service Provider) like - Beltelecom (Minsk), and etc;</p>

<p><strong>ISPs</strong> have built networks and run all the necessary physical cabling that connects millions of computers together in one network.
They also connect to other networks and ISPs; The other network connect to google, universities, etc. Together form the Internet;</p>

<p>Computers on a network have an identifier called an <strong>IP address</strong> which is composed of digits and dots. To access websites like - www.coursera.org - go to the IP address. Devices that can connect to the network have another unique identifier <strong>MAC address</strong> permanemt ad hardcoded onto a device. Eg: - 82:4f:23:59:47:4. When data is sent or received on a network both IP and MAC address must be available.
Data sent through a network is sent in <strong>packets</strong> (bits of binary data); </p>

<p><strong>Networking Hardware</strong></p>

<p>The ways to connect to the Internet:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethernet cable - physically connect to the network through a cable;</li>
<li>WIFI - wireless networking, through radios and antennas;</li>
<li>Fiber optics - expensive and allow greater speed that other methods, contains of glass fibers that move data through light instead of electricity;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Router</strong> - connects lots of different devices together and helps route the network traffic. Router utilizes network protocols to determine where to send the data packet;
<strong>Switches</strong> and <strong>hubs</strong> are devices that help the data travel;</p>

<p><strong>Network Stack</strong> - a set of hardware or software that provides the infrastructure for a computer;</p>

<p><strong>The Language of the Internet</strong></p>

<p>Network protocols - Set of rules in order to route data through a network. Route efficiently, aren&#39;t corrupted, secure, destination, names appropriately;</p>

<p>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and the IP (Interpet Protocol) - TCP/IP:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>IP</strong> - delivers packets to the right computers;</li>
<li><strong>TCP</strong> - handles reliable data transfer between networks;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Web</strong></p>

<p>Many ways to access the internat - web, mail, chat, file sharing, etc;</p>

<p>All websites can be access through the Web. <strong>Websites</strong> are text documents that are formatted with HTML - hypertext markup language - coding language used by web browsers. <strong>Web pages</strong> - made of very basic components, multimedia content.</p>

<p>To navigate into a website you type a url - www.google.com. <strong>URL</strong> - Uniform Resource Locator - is a web address.</p>

<p><strong>Domain Name</strong> - can be registered to ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).
<strong>Domain Endings</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>.edu - education institutions;</li>
<li>.org - organizations, etc;</li>
</ul>

<p>172.217.6.46 - maps to google homepage through a protocal called DNS (Domain Name System). DNS - acts like the Internet&#39;s directory and uses human readable words to map to an IP address.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>IPv4 - It is an address that consist of 32 bits separated into four groups; (Totally &lt; 4.3 billion IP address # websites , users more);</li>
<li>IPv6 - consists of 128bits (4 times of IPv4); - 379f:3e7d:4860:0370:7334:0000; (possibilities 2 power 128);</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NAT</strong> - Network Address Translation - Lets organizations use one public IP address and many private IP addresses within the network
The router may need to be configured with NAT to facilitate communication between the company&#39;s network and the outside world.</p>

<p><strong>What is programming?</strong></p>

<p>Before we can introduce you to some key concepts, we need to make sure we understand what programming really is.</p>

<p>A computer is a hardware machine that can store and process information. The language of a computer is Binary, a complex set of ones and zeroes. Programming is essentially the larger-scale process of developing a complex machine program that acts according to our wishes. Programming is the basic communication between human input and machine output. It is the way that a computer knows how and when to process data.</p>

<p>So, what is coding, then?</p>

<p>Think of coding as a translator between English (or a different human language) and the computer’s binary. Coding involves the actual syntax and structure by which we write commands. A computer can then take those commands, translate it into binary, and do what is written. Coding involves writing commands in a language that a computer can understand. Coding is the initial step in communication with a computer.</p>

<p><strong>What is hardware? What is software?</strong></p>

<p>In order for a computer to work, it requires both hardware and software. Software is a collection of instructions and programs that are downloaded to a computer. These enable a user to interact with the computer. The apps on an iPad or Microsoft Word are examples of software. Hardware, on the other hand, is the physical device that stores, delivers, and executes that software. The physical iPad or monitor would be an example of hardware.</p>

<p>A hardware engineer is responsible for manufacturing and designing devices that interact with software. They will usually have a background in Electrical and Computer Engineering. A software engineer, on the other hand, develops and codes software programs for those devices. They will usually have a background in Software Engineering or Computer Science.</p>

<p><strong>What is front-end? What is back-end?</strong></p>

<p>Within the world of software development, there are two common camps that programmers fall into that utilize different tools, skills, and end-goals: front-end and back-end development.</p>

<p>Front-end development focuses on what the user will actually see on their screen. This involves the design, application debugging, and coding for user experience. This job is all about the feel, look, and design of a program or website.</p>

<p>Back-end development focuses on everything that makes the front-end possible. This job is all about how a site or application works, how quickly it functions, and how it communicates with databases (where data is stored). Many programmers are more generalists on both sides. They are called full-stack developers.
What do I need to learn to be a programmer?</p>

<p>Now that you have your bearings on the world of programming, let’s discuss what you will actually need to learn to become a programmer. We will start with the fundamentals of programming on the whole.</p>

<p>In this section, we will discuss the following need-to-know concepts to become a programmer:</p>

<p>Programming languages
Coding syntax, vocabulary, and lingo
Data structures and algorithms</p>

<p><strong>Programming languages</strong></p>

<p>As we discussed earlier, a programmer writes code that a computer can understand and translate into binary. Just as we use different human languages to communicate, we also use programming languages to communicate with a computer. A programming language is a formal set of notations and rules that function similarly to a human language. They generate instructions and implement algorithms based on the predetermined rules of that language. A computer can then produce an output from that text.</p>

<p>Let’s introduce some of the most important programming languages that you should be aware of as a beginner.</p>

<p>The need-to-know programming languages
There are tons of programming languages, and they each serve different purposes, styles, and specializations. Many programming languages build off of previous ones, and some are developed for particular careers. For example, some languages are better for game development, while others are used for complex robotics.</p>

<p>In order to get you started, let’s get familiar with the ten most popular programming languages out there. Keep in mind that there are many more, and these lists are notoriously subjective!</p>

<p>If you want to get started with any of these languages from scratch, check out Educative’ free beginner’s courses on a variety of programming languages.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Java: this is one of the older, more established programming languages. It is used in universities and large-scale businesses. Java is known for being cross-platform compatible. As programmers say, with Java you can “write once, run everywhere”.</p></li>
<li><p>Python: this is a very user-friendly language preferred by many beginners. The syntax is simple and clear, so many newbies get started on Python. It is commonly used for machine learning, amongst many other uses.</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby: similar to Python, this language is known for being beginner-friendly. It’s easy to read, and it was built on the notion that programming should be fun. Over the years, developers have expressed a consistent love for Ruby.</p></li>
<li><p>JavaScript: this is a text-based language for web development. It must be run through a browser and an HTML document (the basic language of the internet). JavaScript is foundational to all websites.</p></li>
<li><p>C: this is one of the original programming languages, so it’s like the parent language. C is known for being hard to learn, but it works great for high-performance applications.</p></li>
<li><p>C++: this language is based on C and adds new features to the old language. It’s also an older one and is known for having a bit of a learning curve. Many universities still teach C++. Some developers say it makes learning other languages far easier.</p></li>
<li><p>C#: this language, created by Microsoft, is based on C and C++ to make really robust things, like large websites. It is still a very sought-after language, especially for those who have a preference for Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>PHP: this is a scripting language that uses HTML to make websites, but it’s taken off for a lot of other uses. It’s well-loved by programmers and web developers for its broad range usage and simplicity.</p></li>
<li><p>Swift: this language, developed by Apple, is great for iOS and Mac OS apps. It’s designed similarly to Python and Ruby; it is simple and easy to learn. There is a general push to get more Swift programmers in the field.</p></li>
<li><p>Objective-C: this is an older language that is being slowly replaced by Swift, but it is an important language for the history of software development. It is especially useful for creating applications on Mac OS X and iPhone iOS.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Imperative vs. Declarative Paradigms</strong></p>

<p>As we mentioned, programming languages have different styles. In fact, every programming language operates according to a paradigm. A paradigm is basically the way that a computer will logically approach a problem. It is the style of that language. There are many different paradigms out there, and they all fall under two branches: imperative and declarative.</p>

<p>For imperative programming, you tell the compiler what you want to happen to your code. You give it all the steps, and it “listens” to your imperative commands. You give the instructions, not the desired outcome.</p>

<p>For declarative programming, you will write code that describes what you want to happen, but you don’t explain how to get that result. You give the outcome you want, not the instructions to get there.</p>

<p>As a beginner, there are really only two paradigms that you need to know about: Object-Oriented and Functional.</p>

<p>Object-Oriented programming is an imperative paradigm that largely dominates the field. In this paradigm, everything is treated like an object, a thing you can interact with or alter.</p>

<p>Functional programming is a declarative paradigm that thinks about data through sets of tasks, which we call functions.</p>

<p><strong>Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages</strong></p>

<p>A programming language isn’t the only tool necessary for communicating with a computer. After all, the computer “thinks” in binary. Compilers and interpreters take human-readable code and translate it to computer-readable code. A compiled language means that the machine directly translates the program that you input. These tend to be faster and more efficient but require an extra “build” step. An interpreted language, however, requires another program to read and execute the code, sort of like a middle-man. These are generally more portable and require less effort to change the code later.</p>

<p><strong>Basics of coding syntax</strong></p>

<p>Now that you’re familiar with programming languages, let’s take a deeper look at how you write them. We will go over the key concepts and vocab terms to get you familiar with coding syntax.</p>

<p>Note: for these examples, we will be using Python for its readability, so keep in mind that other languages will look different!</p>

<p><strong>Keywords</strong></p>

<p>Just like any human language, a programming language has words with reserved meaning. That’s how any language conveys meaning! Keywords are reserved words that have pre-determined meanings and uses. Each programming language has its own set of keywords, though there is a lot of cross-over. </p>

<p>The keyword var, for example, defines a variable, and the keyword return runs that function and returns the result. Take a look below and try it out yourself once you understand how it works.</p>

<p>Note: In many languages, you can use the # to make notes. The compiler will ignore anything after the number sign.</p>

<p><strong>Identifiers</strong></p>

<p>Identifiers are similar to keywords, but these are the names that the programmer would create to label different entities in their program. We use these to differentiate one entity from another. To create an identifier, you must follow the syntactic rules as outlined by the programming language of your choice. For example, in Python, identifiers must follow these rules:</p>

<p>Identifiers can be a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits (0-9), or an underscore
Keywords cannot be used as identifiers
Identifiers cannot include any special characters like !, @, &amp;, $, %, etc.
They cannot begin with a digit</p>

<p><strong>Variables</strong></p>

<p>Variables allow you to store information that can be accessed over and over again. These are similar to variables in algebra. But in programming, we name our variables according to the syntax of that language. Naming a variable is called declaring a variable. These are useful for any data or value that you want to use more than once. Take a look below and test it out for yourself.</p>

<p>name = &quot;Amanda&quot; # declaring the name
age = 23 # declaring the age</p>

<p><strong>Data Types</strong></p>

<p>As we have learned, programming is all about data processing, and each language has different kinds of data. Data types are like classifications that tell the compiler or interpreter how to use a piece of information. Let’s take a look at four commonly used data types to get a better sense of how they work.</p>

<p>Integers are numbers without decimals, just like in algebra. In fact, they can be used to do algebra in your programs. Integers can be stored in variables so we can use them over and over again.</p>

<p>123
number_of_bagels = 10 - 2
print(number_of_bagels)</p>

<p>Boolean is basically a yes or no response. They will return either True or False. These can serve tons of different purposes, like comparing the equality of two numbers or variables.</p>

<p>123
print(10 &gt; 20) # False
print (10 &gt; 5) # True</p>

<p>Strings are commonly pieces of text in programming languages, such as our Hello World! statement They are written with quotation marks.</p>

<p>print (&quot;Let&#39;s learn programming!&quot;)</p>

<p><strong>Operators</strong></p>

<p>Operators are symbols that perform mathematical functions to your data. There are different categories of operators. The most important operators for you at this stage are the following:</p>

<p>Arithmetic (for simple arithmetic)</p>

<p>Assignment (to assign value)</p>

<p>Relational (for comparison, returning boolean values)</p>

<p>Logical (to return boolean from a boolean input)</p>

<p>a + b = 30
c = a + b 
40 &gt; 30
abc == abc
(2 &lt; 3) and (2 &lt; 5)</p>

<p><strong>Conditionals</strong></p>

<p>Conditionals allow us to perform certain actions depending on a condition. We use booleans to determine if data meets certain requirements, and then define what the program should do if that requirement is or is not met. In other words, we want to tell the computer, “if this thing is true, do this other thing”.</p>
